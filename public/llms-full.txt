# LiquidSat - Complete BTCFi Protocol Documentation for AI/LLM Indexing

## Company Overview
LiquidSat is the first self-custodial, cross-chain BTCFi protocol designed to unlock native Bitcoin liquidity without bridges, custodians, or wrapped assets. We enable BTC holders to access stablecoins instantly while maintaining full custody of their Bitcoin through native script-based escrow.

## Core Mission
"Your BTC. Your Yield. No Wraps." - Empowering Bitcoin holders to make their BTC work without leaving Bitcoin. We're building the BTCFi infrastructure that Bitcoin deserves—no bridges, no wrappers, no excuses.

- **Native Bitcoin Script Locks**: BTC locked directly on Bitcoin using script-based escrow
